A web based chatbot to track the carbon footprint of a user or a household. We expect the user to provide consumption information of various carbon emmisive products and services to calculate the total carbon footprint of the user. 
<br>
This is done by comparing the data provided by the user and average carbon footprint of the device. We also intend to calculate the carbon absorption in the form of trees/plants grown by the user and also the situations in which the most efficient approach was utilized by the user to calculate the net carbon footprint in a day/week/month or year. 
<br>
We hope this will spread awareness about the rising levels of greenhouse gases and encourage people to adopt cleaner and greener lifestyle.

**What is Carbon Footprint???**
<br>
A carbon footprint is the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by an individual, event, organization, service, or product, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent.Greenhouse gases, including the carbon-containing gases carbon dioxide and methane, can be emitted through the burning of fossil fuels, land clearance and the production and consumption of food, manufactured goods, materials, wood, roads, buildings, transportation and other services. 

**Formulas:** 
<br>
<br>
Electricity : Input value (in KWh) X 0.85 (Emission Factor) = Output value in (Kg of CO2)

Petrol: Input Value(In Litres) X 2.296(Emission Factor) = Output value in (Kg of CO2)

Diesel: Input Value(In Litres) X 2.653 (Emission Factor) = Output value in (Kg of CO2)

LPG: Input Value(In Kg) X 2.983 (Emission Factor) = Output value in (Kg of CO2)

Your Carbon Footprint : Add (1+2+3+4) = Output value in (Kg of CO2)
